# Basic Python Syntax
## Python 2

1. Printing output in python 2 :-
   print "argument that you want to print"

2. mathematical operators :-
   x = 8
   y = 4
   print x+y                  # it wil give outout of sum of x and y
   print x-y                  # it will give difference of x and y
   print x/y                  # it will give quotient when x is divided by y
   print x%y                  # it is modulo function and gives remainder when x is divied by y
   print x ** y               # it means x^y. it is way to represnt power operator
   
 3. single line comments can be given by putting # before a line
 
 4. multi line comments can be given by putting 3 double quotes befire and after the lines.
 
 example of putting multiline comments is :
 """ hello
 how are you """
 
 5. To validate a variable to be an integer or a string, use 'isinstance(<var>, <type>)'
 it accepts two parameter
 1. variable name
 2. Type to be validated
 example: isinstance(a, dict) , isinstance(num, integer)
 It return True if true else false.
