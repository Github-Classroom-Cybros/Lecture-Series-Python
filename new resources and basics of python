# it is for python 2

1. Printing output in python 2 :-
   print "argument that you want to print"

2. mathematical operators :-
   x = 8
   y = 4
   print x+y                  # it wil give outout of sum of x and y
   print x-y                  # it will give difference of x and y
   print x/y                  # it will give quotient when x is divided by y
   print x%y                  # it is modulo function and gives remainder when x is divied by y
   print x ** y               # it means x^y. it is way to represnt power operator
   
 3. single line comments can be given by putting # before a line
 
 4. multi line comments can be given by putting 3 double quotes befire and after the lines.
 
 example of putting multiline comments is :
 """ hello
 how are you """
